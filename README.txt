===================================

This software was produced in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Junior Independent Study project.

Requires Python2.7 and RPython (https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Compile with `rpython -Ojit target.py`.

Many thanks to those who maintain the RPython documentation and example code repositories,
not to mention the authors of the CyCy interpreter.
