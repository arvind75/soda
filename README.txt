===================================

This software was produced in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Junior Independent Study project.

Requires Python2.7, RPython (https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and RPly (https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/rply/latest/rply.pdf).


Compile with `rpython -Ojit target.py`.

Many thanks to those who maintain the RPython documentation and example code repositories,
not to mention the authors of the CyCy interpreter.
